This simple web application helps you calculate whether it's more cost-effective to fill up your car with gasoline or ethanol, based on the prices you input. If the price of ethanol is less than or equal to 75% of the gasoline price, it suggests refilling with ethanol; otherwise, it recommends gasoline. Really simple app using js, html and css.
